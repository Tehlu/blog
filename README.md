# Intro

Hello, this is a blog where I'll be adding my thoughts as it relates to tech, programming, etc.


Article #1 Python vs Javascript
Two of my favorite languages. I love Python because of its versatility and simpler synthax.
I love Javascript because it's ubiquitous throughout the web.
I can highlight some of the differences. 

Function declaration: 
Python: def funcName(par: type):
Javascript: function funcName(par) {}
Hoisting(calling before definition) allowed in Js, No hoisting in Py
Doctrings for Py
